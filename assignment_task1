## 2. Questions

### a. What is the medically relevant insight from the article?
This study presents the first single-cell atlas of transcribed cis-regulatory elements (tCREs), built from more than 340,000 cells across 23 human tissues, annotating over 175,000 tCREs.  

**Key findings:**
- Many disease-associated variants lie in non-coding CREs; this work links those variants to cell type–specific regulatory elements.  
- The atlas uncovers how specific cell populations contribute to disease heritability, including Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, myocardial infarction, autoimmune conditions, and neurodegenerative diseases.  
- It provides a framework to pinpoint which cell types and regulatory programs underlie complex traits, advancing prospects for diagnostics and therapeutic targeting.  

### b. Which genomics technology/technologies were used?
- Single-cell 5′ RNA-seq (sc-5′-RNA-seq) to map transcription start sites and identify tCREs.  
- scATAC-seq for comparison of chromatin accessibility and validation of CRE activity.  
- Promoter-capture Hi-C, HiChIP, Hi-C to infer promoter–distal CRE interactions.  
- Integration with public resources (ENCODE, FANTOM5, etc.) to validate epigenomic relevance.

## 3. Further related research questions

### a. List and explain at least three questions/hypotheses extending the analysis
1. **How do non-coding SNPs located in tCREs alter gene regulation and drive risk in diseases such as IBD?**  
   → Testing whether variants in tCREs disrupt gene expression in disease-relevant cell types.  

2. **Which tCREs become activated during immune cell activation, differentiation, or stress responses, and how do these contribute to disease susceptibility?**  
   → Dynamic profiling of immune cells under stimulation or in inflamed tissues.  

3. **Can we identify common regulatory modules across autoimmune diseases versus disease-specific modules?**  
   → This could highlight shared pathways or unique therapeutic targets.
